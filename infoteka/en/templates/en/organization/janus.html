    <p class="lead">
        Janus is our Groupeâ€‹ guide on operations, procedures and behaviours.<br><br>
        Its about compliance, rules, code of conduct and, as such, it remains a restrictive and binding framework for
        the whole Groupe. In a world of defiance of corporations, of suspicion towards financial systems, etc.,

        confidence.<br><br>
        We urge all and everyone to read Janus and to disseminate it, as all entities across the Groupe must abide by
        these rules.
